# Amar1729 Lua-lsp

Simple reference tap for https://github.com/Alloyed/lua-lsp/ while playing around with my own lspconfig setup. I will probably not spend a lot of time on this.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install amar1729/lua-lsp/lua-lsp`

Or `brew tap amar1729/lua-lsp` and then `brew install lua-lsp`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
